## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### 1. Backend Server Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Backend server wasn't running, causing API endpoint failures
- **Solution**: Started backend server with proper environment configuration
- **Tests Fixed**: Health Check, User Registration, User Login, Protected Route Access

### 2. Frontend Serving Issues ✅  
- **Problem**: React dev server had HOST environment variable conflicts
- **Solution**: Served production build using `serve` package on port 3000
- **Tests Fixed**: Frontend Page Load, Static Assets loading

### 3. Database Connectivity ✅
- **Problem**: SQLite database wasn't accessible when servers were down
- **Solution**: Backend server initialization creates and configures database automatically
- **Tests Fixed**: Database CRUD Operations
